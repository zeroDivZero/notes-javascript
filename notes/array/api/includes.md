# `includes()`

Determines if array includes certain value among its entries, returning `true` or `false`. Case-sensitive when comparing strings or characters.

```js
const pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'bat'];
console.log(pets.includes('cat')); // true
console.log(pets.includes('Cat')); // false
```

Takes `searchElement`, value to search for, and optionally `fromIndex`, position at which to begin searching.
