# WHAT IS

Lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time (JIT) compiled programming language with first-class functions. Most well-known as Web's scripting language, but also used in non-browser environments such as `node`, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat.

Prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

Standards are ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402).
